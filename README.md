# Lauren Peters-Collaer Design Portfolio

A React application showcasing the design work of graphic designer Lauren Peters-Collaer. Originally cloned from a Squarespace template, this project will eventually be connected to a headless CMS, allowing the end user (Lauren) to be able to add, remove, and update project information as needed.

### Prerequisites
Be sure to have Node.js and Git installed on your machine. 

### Installing
After cloning into a local copy of the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to start a local server on localhost:3000. Navigate to localhost:3000 in any browser to view the application in a local setup.
